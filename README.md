# DeustchAlgorithm
Deutsch's Algorithm is an important quantum algorithm that was one of the first examples of quantum algorithms that are exponentially faster than their classical counterparts. It determines if a given function f:{0,1}->{0,1} is constant or binary. If the function is constant, it produces the same output for all inputs; whereas if the function is balanced, it will produce 1 for half of the input domain and 0 for the other half. It can complete this in a single query compared to the minimum of 2 required for any classical algorithm. To implement this algorithm, I am using the PennyLane library along with Python. A quantum circuit with 2 qubits is initialized. Hadamard gate is applied to both qubits. An oracle[A black box] is then implemented which for constant function,leaves the state unchanged but for balanced function using CNOT gate changes the output based on the input. Another hadamard gate is then applied to induce inference and then using expectation value of the Pauli-Z operator, resulting state of first qubit is measured. if expectation is near +1,the funciton is constant while if it is near -1, the function is balanced.
